# Portfolio Management for Indian Equity Markets
[![Build Status](https://github.com/bhanuprasanna527/CapiPort/actions/workflows/HF_sync_space.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bhanuprasanna527/CapiPort/actions)


## Overview

Welcome to our project on portfolio management for Indian equity markets! This project aims to help individuals efficiently allocate their money between different equities, optimizing returns while managing risk.

## Features

- **Dynamic Allocation:** Our technique dynamically allocates funds among various equities based on a robust methodology.
- **Risk Management:** The project incorporates risk management strategies to enhance overall portfolio stability.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Access the tool through our user-friendly web interface [here](https://capiport.streamlit.app/).

    python main.py

## Technique used (Version 1) 
###  Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization
Overview

Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization is a widely used method in finance for constructing an investment portfolio that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk, or equivalently minimizes risk for a given level of expected return. This approach was pioneered by Harry Markowitz and forms the foundation of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).
Methodology
1. Basic Concepts

    Expected Return (μpμp​): The anticipated gain or loss from an investment, based on historical data or other factors.
    Risk (Variance (σp2σp2​)): A measure of the dispersion of returns. In portfolio optimization, we seek to minimize the variance of the portfolio returns.

2. Mathematical Formulation

The basic idea is to find the optimal weights wiwi​ for each asset in the portfolio to maximize the expected portfolio return μpμp​ while minimizing the portfolio variance σp2σp2​. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   
   ```bash
   Maximize:   μ_p = ∑(w_i * μ_i)
   Subject to: ∑w_i = 1
   Minimize:   σ_p^2 = ∑(∑(w_i * w_j * σ_ij))


where:
    NN is the number of assets in the portfolio.
    μiμi​ is the expected return of asset ii.
    σijσij​ is the covariance between the returns of assets ii and jj.

3. Optimization Algorithm

Our implementation utilizes the following steps:

    Input Data: Historical returns for each asset in the portfolio.
    Objective Function: Construct an objective function that combines the expected return and variance.
    Optimization Algorithm: We employ a mean-variance optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts the weights to find the optimal combination.
    Convergence Criteria: The algorithm iterates over a specified number of iterations (e.g., 5000) or until convergence is achieved.

4. Implementation

In our project, we have implemented the Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization method with 5000 iterations. The process involves:

    Input: Historical return data for each equity in the Indian market.
    Objective: Maximize expected return while minimizing portfolio variance.
    Optimization: Utilize an iterative approach, adjusting weights to find the optimal allocation.
    Output: The final set of weights that represent the optimal portfolio allocation.
